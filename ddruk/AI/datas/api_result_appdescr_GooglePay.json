I can't use the app with the current changes. Previous Review Very good banking software that does it everything. I adore this application. If the PPF account can also be examined, it would be fantastic. The user interface is quite intuitive, and the application is light and quick. I've watched this software develop from a basic version with limited features to the robust version it is today. far superior to its rival banking apps.", "Google Pay is my go-to UPI app for all my digital transactions. It's incredibly user-friendly, allowing me to send and receive money effortlessly. The interface is intuitive, making navigation a breeze. What I appreciate most is its reliability; transactions are swift and secure. Plus, the app offers a range of services like bill payments and recharge options, making it a one-stop solution for all my financial needs. Highly recommended!", "It has been over three years since the Flutter-based version was released, yet the app still feels very sluggish and jittery even on a flagship phone, especially during scrolling. However, I really like the fact it stores transaction history indefinitely, and doesn't hide the VPA of online merchants in transaction history, which PhonePe is notorious for. It would have been great if you could add an option to copy transaction details to clipboard.", "I loved this app....!!!! In my experience of using the app for all kinds of payments and others, the performance is outstanding and smooth. The app layout and interface is very impressive. The cash back points for various payments is an added bonus. Kudos to the App team. However a small point to note for improvement. When the phone is on mobile data and not on wifi, a pop up appears frequently at the bottom saying \" No internet available\". So everytime it has to be clicked and removed....!", "Unique features are very interesting. The Fastest And Greatest App...But for the past month, it hasn't been functioning properly. I am able to use any barcode to scan and process payments. But my keyboard does not appear when I want to transfer money to someone via mobile. Not at all. Help, please; I've tried everything. I deleted the app's data and cache and even uninstalled and reloaded it. But, all in vain. Even after searching Google and YouTube, I still can't seem to grasp the issue.", "Everything is fine. But, recently I got an issue like my transaction is failed due to network issue. And in the transaction history the status is failed. But my money got debited from the bank account and I didn't got any message like money got debited,but when I check my balance the money got debited. Then, I raised a ticket. They said the money will be credited within 3days. Now, they are asking for the bank statement after 3 days. I really don't like this feature. Please fix this.", "I am big time user of gpay app. I am happy about the app for what it offers. However the biggest gripe is that there is no quick way to get back to next payment scan after completing one. After completing a payment, I have to hit 'Done' then it takes to me to the page with transaction history for that merchant account. In order to start a new transaction I have to go back and then select the option, it is a hassle like this. Please provide quick way to get back to make a next payment.", "Since the last few days I've ran through some new issue which never occured before. I tried to reset my Pin and somehow it interfaces with a statement \"something went wrong with the bank servers\". Although this could be an issue with the Bank but I believe that if the developers take a deeper look into this app, then the issue could potentially be resolved. Hope you'll look forward into this.", "I have been a user of Google Pay for a considerable period, but recently, my experience has been less than satisfactory. For the past month, Google Pay has been consistently showing a 'Something went wrong' error during bank transactions. This issue is specific to Google Pay, as other payment apps work fine. Disappointing, considering its previous reliability.", "I like how easily the payments can be done in some cases. However most of the time when making bank payments, it shows trouble. Whenever you want to make a payment two in a row it stops. Also, the cashback and reward were good first but now they are not useful, relevant or good. The four offers you get after payment are all bad and not useful. Plus, they say to complete tasks for cashback and even if you do that, you won't get the offered cashback. So you can only use it for small payments.", "I keep getting \"Something went wrong\" error while trying to add my Visa credit card for tap and pay. The worst part is it won't even tell me exactly what went wrong. This is so stupid. Have a clear error message at least! I've tried updating the app, clearing the data and cache as well but nothing seems to work. This is a pathetic experience!!! Fix it asap.", "Nice working \ud83d\ude00 The app is excellent as long as the user does not install plugins. I have seen many enemies using no recoil, unlimited bullets, without even reloading the sniper. They can easily identify enemies from extra distance. This is disappointing now. Hackers are increasing every day. What plan have you made to deal with this problem?? Please do something to avoid installation of additional plugins. best regards", "To view your card info you have to open up chrome and go to autofill. If you want to adjust payment settings you need to go the Google app instead. But if you want to tap-to-pay you use google wallet, but if you want to view your transactions you have to use this pointless app. Google took the concept of uncomplicated, convenient, and all in one place, and said \"let's do the polar opposite!\" Half of google searches are just people troubleshooting stupid issues that Google itself created", "I've been using it for a while. Really convenient not needing to dig for my wallet everytime. My only wish is that there was some way to get digital receipts when you pay, and they appear in the wallet/pay app. Pretty sure the checkout retail needs to update in order to achieve this, but you'd think saving paper receipts would be good motivation. Still... It's a great app.", "If I could rate 10 stars I would. I can't say enough good things about Cash App! I use it for all my banking needs. I get paid 3 days early, I save money with roundups, my ATM fees are reimbursed and now I have $50 free overdraft protection! Love this app more than PayPal or Venmo. So easy to send and receive $. No waiting for verification or anything. And almost everyone is on cash app. Super easy to look people up whether or not they are on your contact list", "As a Prominent Google pay user, initially thrilled with its rewards and simplicity. App UI remains excellent, but recent times see it swamped with irrelevant third-party ad offers, pushing valuable cashbacks and rewards into the shadows. Payment system, thankfully, stays fast and reliable. Needs a focus on user value over flashy extras to retain loyal fans.", "I am facing this issue for a while now. There is a technical glitch on the app wherein this doesn't go to the UPI password screen and gets stuck at the beginning. My device is Motorola edge 30 pro. Looks like this is device specific. The work around which I follow is a restart of device. This is happening for almost 6 months now and shows up once in a while. Tried reaching the GPay support but call got disconnected. Can you guys fix it?", "The app is very much user friendly . But recently I installed on my new Samsung A05 model and I found the sensitivity of app key board is very low . Due to this error happens while inputting pin number and transaction fails . Also key board size is so big that it is not fitting within mobile screen size . I reinstalled app 4 to 5 times but no improvement . Otherwise it functioning very good .", "if payments stucks at processing it takes so much time to update. Customers just want fast update it may be failed or success they just want confirmation so that if it fails they will try other payment methods. its pathetic & embarrassing to wait until its update. merchants won't wait they want second payment. if both success then our money gone if that merchant is stranger. please fix this issue. Swipe right to scan was a great feature i liked that very much. please bring that back", "Till last month, i paid my bills. But now it's not updating the new bill. I keep getting \"Something went wrong\" error while trying to get the electricity & LPG Cylinder bills updated. I tried updating the app, clearing the cache memory, but still the same. This is very irritating!", "GPay is my goto money transfer app, as it's UI and all the updates fulfill everything the users need. But, I've only 2 drawbacks regarding Gpay. 1. There's a lot of time the payment gets failed. But, it shows bank server issues. It would be better if this message can be shown before the transaction. 2. There should be tag available to the payment done (i.e. after the payment) Like Paytm. It only allow us to tag before the payment. If we forgot to mention the tag then it's over. Need solution.", "Application is good. i have 2 suggestion. 1) Allow favorite or bookmark feature, so user doesnt need to serach unknown, unsaved contacts. 2) Transaction history should have filter option. IMPORTANT FEATURE MISSING ON GAPY Payment favourite feature is not available? I do some recurring payment monthly, it's very difficult to find those numbers. It would be great if we can give favourite feature to see all your important contact or payment receiver at one place.", "The user interface is not as polished as the United States version. The debit and credit cards should be on the main page and the people and business should go on the side menu it's really annoying to go all the way down for the bills and payment options those should be given a better place in the main page. Hoping for a revamp.", "The recent update made me unlink my bank account ,no matter what I do, the registered sim doesn't get detected for the particular bank . Try registering again using the registered mobile sim alone and even mobile banking is activated in my bank app, it even shows my balance whereas Gpay doesn't even show my live existing account . Worst experience ever couldn't transfer money for a week . ONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE. Wish I could rate 0stars", "Very efficient for paying on the go if you are using a NFC equipped phone. I use it on personal & business lines, most of which are not NFC enabled, but it eases check out verification times with every site you visit. Now one thing to beware and be very careful of... Seems no matter how old the account or last credit card used....once Google links your debt, it will take the money from every place it can, even if years have passed. So make your choices wisely and maybe pay your bills. \ud83d\ude19", "Gpay stopped opening since yesterday, goes to black screen. It is definitely a bug may be with screen size during loading. Get the developers to fix it Google, stop telling users to use latest app which itself causes the issue, i have tried re installing it, doesn't work. How ever if i split my screen than it works in a small splitted screen. Thank you for fixing it quickly. \u2b50 \u2b50 \u2b50\u2b50 \u2b50", "After adding rupay cards, it takes more time to done the payment. It takes atleast a minute to complete the payment. Due to this, I've lost a amount where I done a payment in other app, but the transaction done in both.", "The application is a nice and performing very well but there is some feature is missing in security section like while adding new account there must be a two step verification like OTP from mobile device as well as from email also to add bank account for security reasons please add this features in this. Thanks.", "Unable to add account on new device. Bank details, phone nos etc. information is all correct. I am getting a message that your account is temporarily suspended without any reason. Can't even uninstall the app from phone to try reinstalling.", "The google pay app is not working  since yesterday for some reason, I don't know. Whenever I opened it, it required me to draw phone security pattern and then just black blank screen.  After tyring multiple times I cleared data and uninstalled the app to reinstall it. Still it didn't open. That intial logo displays then the same black screen continues. I reinstalled it 3-4 times still it is not opening. Kindly check what is happening and let me know as soon as possible.", "I find it absolutely absurd that this app is somehow tied to the system screen-lock and not using an app unlock feature like any banking app or venmo. At a minimum you should at least be able to choose or have a setting that lets you toggle between one and the other. The problem is that when someone has an idea, it's not always a good idea and your peers need to speak up in a respectful way.", "Google pay was so good at first but now there aren't even rewards given properly like it shows better luck next time i mean it's such a disappointment for the customers, i would really want good coupons for customers more likely related to zepto, swiggy, Zomato, uber, ola, rapido and so on and pls fix the bugs!!", "Thank you, Google Pay, for providing a secure and convenient way to make payments and manage finances. Your easy-to-use interface, fast transactions, and integration with various payment methods simplify the process of sending and receiving money. I am grateful for the seamless payment experience, enhanced security features, and rewards programs you offer, making financial transactions effortless for me as a Medical Doctor.", "I recently experienced a sense of disappointment with Google Pay due to the introduction of a convenience fee. As a loyal user, I have always appreciated the convenience and efficiency the platform provided. However, the imposition of this additional fee has left me feeling unsatisfied and I'm not happy for this new update I had about extra fee\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14", "Any UPI app should install a cancellation process. Sometimes the urgent pqyments are stuck.A stranger won't let me take his goods unless he received the payment. The money can either be refunded or be successful transacted. I won't let anyone take double benefit of the poor processing of payments. The processing payments should be dealt within hours not days.", "Payments initiated are getting struck somewhere in the flow, but this app continues for hours to process those rather than allowing customers to cancel the payment.. customer anyway has to pay through alternate channels for service/product than waiting for completion. But those in process transactions are also getting completed later, which results in multiple payments. no straight forward process to raise issues to get money back.... very pathetic... basic issues are not considered...", "Google files safe folder-I have extra storage space, rebooted, cleared the cache, stable internet connection etc.. but still the update doesn't seem to be getting installed onto safe folder(just 0-5kb/s). I have around 10gb of files in safe folder. Can i copy the folder to different device and access it again after reinstalling the app?", "Such a worst UPI payment app. Not recommended to anyone even in tough time too. Even in these days also, the transactions are getting processed for days together and Literally it's taking 3 working days to resolve it. The way technical team works to resolve the customer issues is too worst. Look at other UPI app customer support, if the money got debited and not credited to beneficiary then within an hours things are getting resolved.", "Pathetic app. Payment gets debited from your account & shows still processing. Beneficiary confirmed the payment has not been credited. It doesn't happen one time or two times, but happens on several occasions. Its so embarrassing, when your payment fails. I will not recommend Google pay to anybody. Kindly use other upi apps for payments.", "Very bad app. Once you remove your sim card from your phone the app will need a verification when you re-enter your sim. And this verification process is too much slow. I have a full week and so more but my verification is yet pending. Just after clicking the option \"Verification by sms\", your internet speed will gradually fall and never your verification will be done. I have just uninstalled thisapp.I advice everyone not to install it.
