        "Horrible experience even with premium Whenever I try to play songs from \"liked songs\" it just takes way too long to load. Tried clearing cache, still no effect, another issue is when swiping on the album cover to change the song it gets stuck for .3 secs and then changes to the next song. Might have to look for another music streaming service if this isn't fixed.",
        "I loved Spotify at first. But it started irritating me where the premium adds started to come. 1. I can't move the song forward or Backward. 2. I can't play songs on order in my playlist. 3. I can't even sometimes see the lyrics of the song. 4. You get adds twice a song. All over to say.. I should have given this app a 1star. But I still don't hate it. I know they do it cuz they want money. But you can't take our choice of songs. Pls lower the disadvantages of non - premium.",
        "This was the best app for any song enthusiast who loved streaming music or listening to podcasts online, but now the above cannot be said. The app has finally shifted towards making and maximizing profit and giving less and less features which are basic in other applications. The (basic) features are also being stripped away such as playing whatever song we like, skipping songs, etc. The experience has now deteriorated to a level that the app is now very hard to use on a regular basis.",
        "1 star reasons: If I stop listening song at some part and start listening again then I can't restart the song from beginning I have to listen from the part I left it. I can't listen songs in order I want, smart shuffle is very bad. Limit has been set for skips. If I skip a song then instead of playing the song that is next in the playlist, it plays a random song from the playlist. I didn't have much problem with no. of ads before but now because of above points I would like to say too many ads.",
        "This app used to be really good but now it has just been focused on how to make people buy the premium version... You don't allow me to rewind or play on loop, I can't skip more than 6 songs in a hour... you are just denying basic services... I'd rather listen to music on YouTube Music it's just better than you it just doesn't allow me to play music in the background well that works for me atleast I can play what I want to listen to.... I don't recommend this app at all... I am deleting it.",
        "I can find many songs in spotify, the experience was great, until they made almost everything premium. Not able to select and hear songs by our choice, not able to see lyrics for every song, not able to skip songs, not able to add any song to queue, not able to play songs in loop etc. Each of the following things always need premium for them to work I hope *at least* spotify changes even just 1 thing I mentioned. Let everyone, not only me, listen to songs in peace.",
        "I've been a premium user for a couple yrs now. Never faced a major issue everything worked well. But after the new update everything looks broken. I'm unable to play a single song on loop. And the whole concept of loop button looks broken to me. This is the worst update you've provided till date. Even the shuffle button doesn't seem to work as before. You can't make such stupid mistakes.",
        "Once upon a time Spotify was the best songs app but now it became a dictator. You can't play songs as per your wish the app itself play the songs in shuffle order of you select the playlist. You can't even play a song from middle of can't replay your favorite part of the song. You can't skip more than 6 songs per hour. Ads after every song and what not. You can get rid of this only if you take premium membership.",
        "1. we can't play another song in between 2. we can't navigate between the songs 3. we can't play the songs at loop nor can shuffle by our own choice 4. too many adds 5. we can't see the lyrics 6. the changed like icon is trash 7. another song starts playing even if it's not in the queue or your playlist i wish they could provide us basic facilities being a music app, i wish 0 starts was an option to rate. wonderful. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!",
        "This app was totally amazing when we were annoyed only by ads. But now we can't even listen to songs in peace. Thanks to the features you introduced which restrict us only 6 skips, we can't even listen to songs again and can't even move to our favourite part of the song. Everything here requires premium. This is really annoyed and ridiculous.",
        "easily the most user unfriendly app I've ever used. some how it only keeps getting worse. can't go back to the previous song, can't replay a song, can't choose what song I want to play, only six skips in an hour and so much more? how are ads not even the worst part of this app? the cash grab is so blatant and so disgusting. they're lucky 0 stars aren't a thing. I would suggest absolutely not using spotify. there's plenty of better substitutes to give your money to.",
        "It was an amazing music app earlier. But now it's extremely disgusting!! Most of the controls are seized and only available for the premium subscribers. For the users who use the free version of the app, there are so many restrictions! Once, it gave me a message: \"You can't play any song, any time. Go for premium!\" When I tried to play a song of my choice. Then I had to complain about this. They fixed the issue for sure, but then it happened again within the same week. Very annoying!Disappointed",
        "Spotify was such a good app to listen music, with lyrics and a variety of great music. You could even explore new songs with it's new feature in the playlist section, it would add songs in the playlist according to the particular kind of playlist. You could even put a song on repeat, now? Nah. It has become trash. Every little thing needs a premium now. A person can't even listen music peacefully without spending money on apps. As the app gets new updates, it keeps getting worse. Disappointing.",
        "I'm a person who suggested spotify to many. I loved spotify before. And now I've started to get irritated by this app. Adds are fine, but not able to repeat same song and not able to move song backwards and forward is tooooooo irritating. This feature made me see other music platforms. Very bad experience for those who love music, and nothing less than a emotional pain for those who listen songs on spotify for almost entire day.",
        "I have used Spotify for well over 5 years, most of the time I was free user, but last year I upgraded and got yearly premium everything was amazing, but when I got on free plan just a week ago, it's been a nightmare, most of the basic features are blocked too. Why can't I see my queue or even add a song to queue. I understand you want more people to opt for premium but you just can't make it an exclusive premium app either. Just last year Spotify free was usable but now unfortunately it's not.",
        "What can be worse than not being able to go to previous song? Spotify : Challenge accepted. 6 skips an hour. Cant go back, cant go next either. What next? Demo versions of songs? play first 20 seconds, buy premium for full song? We understand adds, but taking away the choice of what song user wants to listen defeats the core purpose of creating a music app. Shame.",
        "Till I was a premium member there was no issue with app. The moment I become normal user they have restricted below features which are very basic to any app. 1. Fwd and Rev seeking of song is disabled. 2. Shuffle is disabled. 3. Looping and repeating the song is disabled. 4. Going back to previous track is not possible. 5. Even replaying the track is not possible, since previous track button itself disabled. If want to play that song again I need to go to playlist again select the song.",
        "Why do you keep on removing all the basic features spotify. We didn't have any problems earlier even there were some ads in between. But it has become too annoying now. I can even play a song from specif part, too much ads in between songs, cannot add music to queue and lot more annoying things on the go. Its like we don't have any options if we don't go premium. Too much profit mentality from these guys. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e",
        "This is the worst update ever. You have to pay to skip the song or repeat it. We need to pay to play the songs in order. This is my favorite music app and I am using it for almost 2 and a half years. This account is used on various devices. Why are you making us to pay for the essential or the main features for the comfort of the customer. You're getting worse . The app's playing random songs which we don't want to hear at that moment. Pls make it more usable and normal like the previous update.",
        "Don't install. I had been listening to music on Spotify for 2 years before this but now I am about to uninstall it. I am also a person who suggested Spotify to many. I loved Spotify before. And now I've been started to get irritated by this app. Adds are fine, but not able to repeat same song and not able to move song backward and forward is to very very bad experience for those who love music, and nothing less than a emotional pain for those who listen songs on Spotify for almost entire a day.",
        "I used to love Spotify. But ever since the premium thing popped up, it's became really annoying. 1)I can't skip to specific parts of the song. 2)I can't replay a song. 3)There is a limit to even choose the music you wanna play. 4)You can't get more than 6 skips per hour. 5)It doesn't allow to play songs in queue. 6)It only allows to play the playlist in shuffle. 7)There are so many ads and on top of that, 2 at a time. Well, that's pretty much it. I hope this issue gets fixed!",
        "I have been using Spotify since it's inception, but the recent improvements make me wonder if Spotify is improving or retrogressing. That some important features -like \"replay\"- are removed doesn't make any sense. I have deleted the app on three of my devices... You can return this feature and improve on what was not there before. That's more reasonable. Not willing to rate this one star also.",
        "If there was an option for 0 stars I would definitely prefer that. The app made us hate it by its own acts. They made almost changed to premium. You can't replay a perticular part of song!!, Random songs keep playing which are not even sometimes in our playlists, the samrt shuffle is so irritating!!, You can't even play songs in your order. Random adds keep popping up after every song and so onn. I would not recommend to download it at any cost as it will only waste your data and time.CONGRATS!!",
        "Congrats!! Thanks to the option of atleast giving 1 star or u would prefer giving O. I mean ads and all are fine but what's the case with can't play songs on loop, can't go back to a song, can't choose shuffle in the correct order, can't navigate through the songs. And above all...I can't even skip more than 6 songs per hour. Spotify mixes two polar genres and now I can't even skip. Amazing!!!",
        "It was great, IN THE PAST. Then they started moving every single feature to premium, which I feel is completely senseless! Like the fact that you can't skip to a specific part, or atleast rearrange your album... AND WHY DO I GET ADS BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE SONG? Isn't that too much? Also I've been facing problems logging in recently... When I enter my credentials, it says \"account not found\", and when I try creating a new account with the same email ID, it says \"Account already exists\"!!",
        "This was the best app but now it's become the worst. I don't know why spotify is begging to take premium. We rewind or choose any part of the song to play. Moreover now we can play our playlist peacefully because of smart shuffle. Also we can't skip songs if we skip more than 6 songs. We can play a song once per day. Means if you play a song and then you want to play it again you can't. It says that you have to play it the next day.",
        "It was a great app at the starting but later on it just became annoying. I can't even choose songs now. It's just irritating. I know Spotify wants money and so does this so that people would take a premium but if this keeps going on then people would rather Uninstall the app all along. I hope that Spotify fix this and not always focus or let's say force people to take a premium. Overall the app is super great, I recommend my friends too thus and they loved it",
        "This app was great a few years ago but now .. it is a nightmare . The repeat button is blocked for a unknown reason. We cant scroll through songs but now they crossed the line. WE CANT EVEN CHOOSE THE SONG WE ARE LISTENING.I can't use my money for songs . I can't switch my music aap cuz all the songs and all my playlist are in this filthy app. Thanks for giving me the worst user experience EVER",
        "Your are ruining the whole music experience with advertising way too much, I listen to one song and then next two ads. One can't have that good feeling of a song or continue to flow on that, well may be if that's how you to plan getting users to buy your premium service's, it sucks! If you are Spotify premium user, and switched to a free plan. It's pure chaos, because the platform tries in all the ways possible to get you back on premium plan, doesn't allow you to play songs in a list.",
        "Terrible UI. Doesn't work in offline mode intuitively - I have a lot of downloaded playlists and it doesn't load in offline mode until I've already loaded the playlist when there's net. It's supposed to be accessible offline! All playlists are on basis of what I set, there's no way to shuffle songs overall. Everything is user curation which is too much work.",
        "Superb app ..just superb \ud83d\udc4d Whether it is songs or podcasts, the recommendations are definitely better than other apps.The option of saving a song or episode in various playlists simultaneously is best and the new feature of displaying captions on screen while listening podcasts is really helpful rather than to read transcripts. Thank you for improving user's experience",
        "It was good at the beging. But updates this app is going on crazy. I can't even forward or backward the song play. Many times the app gets hanged.Sometimes the songs which are need to be played willnt be played. Instead some other song from any playlist or liked song will be play.Repeated ads irritates too much. \"IT WAS BETTER IN BEGINNING.\"",
        "I used to love this app so much but now it has been very irritating. After every few songs you have to listen to adds about UPGRADING TO PREMIUM, when I DO NOT WANT TO. Recently I have been facing some more problems, I went to spotify to listen to some music and everytime I wanted to play a specific song it would show me the pop up of EXPLORE PREMIUM. I can listen to the adds but the app isn't even allowing me listen music now.",
        "spotify was literally the best app but now the new updates are so bad that they don't even let us listen to a specific part of a song again and again. all these updates are so stupid. we can't even replay a song half way through listening it. we can't even choose the songs we want to play after a certain time, and it asks us to come again the next day to choose the songs we want to listen, this is literally so stupid.",
        "After each song I get an Ad and that blasts my mind off. After Spotify applied two ads at the same time, my Mind became a volcano and you know what, I can't even QUEUE songs right now and this is a major issue for listeners who depend on their queues. Plz allow queues Spotify. And after the last update I just don't think I will make it alive. Spotify, you completely ruined the experience of music listening. Plz do something. If you can't then I guess I have to switch apps.",
        "The new update has made it worse. The ads come all the time. Sometimes it make me think that is this a music platform or ad platform. After a song a lady comes and say that you are not subscribed to our primium for 5 sec then background music of 30 sec plays. The que function does not work. The repeat function does not work. I would recommend free users to download ad blocker from play store. It will help a lot to block that annoying ads. I also use it. New users don't download this.",
        "Before it use to be filled with ads, now it has, this smart shuffle which requires premium subscription, just because we want to listen to those songs which we have saved in our playlist not others. Its a complete mess now, we cant even change songs for more thn 6 times and , can't even proceed songs we are listening. Just because there are lots of users due to the quality of the songs, that's why you're messing up with the audiences now.",
        "used to be an awesome music listening app, now, the changes the developers have made are quite disappointing. spotify is practically abusing its free users. the advertisements are reasonable, yes but the fact that the basic features are now only given to premium members is disgraceful. we cant have more than 6 skips, cant play a specific part of a song, cant go back to the previous song, cant queue songs, cant turn shuffle off, and sometimes random songs that aren't even in ur playlist come up:/",
        "Spotify's approach to charging for every basic function is extremely disappointing. Not only are users bombarded with ads unless they pay up, but even basic features like looping songs or fast-forwarding/backwarding are behind a paywall. It's frustrating to feel nickel-and-dimed for every little convenience. Considering the plethora of other streaming options available, Spotify's restrictive and monetized approach leaves much to be desired.",
        "Worst app. Only ads you can listen to this app. And you can't skip songs after 6 skip... Just wow. And everytime they crying for premium membership. Without premium, a normal people can only listen the ads, no music and all. And you can't search new songs there are limits for searching also. Go check some other music apps. I don't recommend this app to anyone."
