I use prepaid services from jio and when I try to recharge using Google Pay, it's showing plans are not updated and the same is going on for a long time. I have been using Gpay for all kinds of bill payments and recharge as it was easy to access everything at one place. But now that these kind of issues are frequent and if not resolved, I think I need to ditch Gpay, search for some other service for these transactions.",
