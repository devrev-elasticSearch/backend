The app support team is asking for bank statements to resolve the issue, which is not user-friendly. Another issue is the 'Something went wrong' error while adding Visa credit cards for tap and pay. The app fails to provide a clear error message, even after trying various solutions like updating, clearing data and cache. This experience is highly unsatisfactory and needs to be fixed immediately.\"",
