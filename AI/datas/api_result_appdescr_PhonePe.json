        "Best And Superfast App...But, not working properly from the last month. I can scan any barcode and make the payment through it. But, when opt for mobile transfer to any person, my keyboard does not pop up. Not at all. Please help, as I tried everything. I cleared its data, cache, and even unistalled & reinstalled the app. But, all in vain. I have not been able to understand the problem even after looking for it on google & Youtube.",
        "After Paytm crash, had to move onto this. Facing two issues: 1. If password is on, then there is no way to come out of app without entering correct password. 2. After successful txn the entire screen is turning green, very annoying. Rather success text should be green and only key fields like amount, reciver's name should be highlighted. Suggest to hire proper UX expert for app's UI design.",
        "Title: Seamless and Efficient Transactions Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 I've been using the Phone Pay app for a while now, and it has truly revolutionized the way I handle transactions. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate through various features. One of the standout aspects is the seamless integration with multiple payment options. Whether it's transferring money to friend",
        "Clean interface with not too many add or selling banners like other UPI app. (read Paytm). Phone pe used to be good till recent update. Despite setting up credit card bill payment, still have to enter the card number again! Good for UPI, however, wallet feature does not have wide acceptance that Paytm Wallet. has and is certainly slower than its rivals. Frequency of transactions getting stuck is more, and overall app functioning/processing is also slower, compared to its rivals.",
        "The overall experience with PhonePe is good for me..I'm using it from the beginning.. kindly change the UI a little bit more and remove ads or reduce it.. and why the qr scanner is in the top right corner..it should be in the middle for handy reach out.. make the app more fluid ..in the bottom of the app make qr scanner and balance check section and and show your qr not the insurance, credit etc..Hope developers will listen to this suggestions.. Thank You .. \ud83d\ude0a",
        "I like the app. Much better than its competitors. But after every update, it is getting more and more complicated. Like in the home page, just at the top you can see it is written \"Add an Address\". It is absolutely unnecessary since we have our location ON whenever we use app. & when you see it again and again, you are left with no option than to fill your address there. So I think you should make your app easy to go.",
        "The app is overall good, the payments are super fast, the Ul is good. However, the payments history can be made so much better. You can't pay someone you received money from directly (there is no option, you have to manually type the upi id visible by changing screens over and over again, save it and then send, if the user is a paytm user and uses their phone number as upi id, you can't see it fully. Also sometimes the upi id you paid to is not even visible. I have no other complaint.",
        "PhonePe is my go-to UPI app for all my digital transactions. It's incredibly user-friendly, allowing me to send and receive money effortlessly. The interface is intuitive, making navigation a breeze. What I appreciate most is its reliability; transactions are swift and secure. Plus, the app offers a range of services like bill payments and recharge options, making it a one-stop solution for all my financial needs. Highly recommended!",
        "I've been using the PhonePe app for a while now, and it has truly simplified my financial transactions. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate through various features. Phonepe is one the best digital payments apps I have used so far. I was using paytm since 2016 when UPI was introduced but now I have switched to phonepe considering it's fast services (i.e. customer support services, and other payments related issues) to users.",
        "I found some features being forced upon the users. Mainly 2 such things. 1. There's a sound that is played when payment is done. They've not given any option to disable that sound. 2. Address. It's useless option. Why do you want people to update their address for no reason? I think it's cheap thinking to impose such things on users.",
        "Reliable, easy to use and fast! Edit: Suggestion: The app is 80% used for payments. The Scan Icon should be somewhere in the center or at the bottom of the screen. Currently the scan icon is on the top of the screen, which is not easily accessible. Specially old people with unsteady hands and low eyesight struggle to click on the scan icon. The UI/UX team should focus more on the usability",
        "I was very happy with the app but since last month I don't see the transactions getting updated in the contact person's list. It shows in the history of the user, but not in the list (to contact number -> open the person's name -> and the latest details are not showing). Also I'm unable to reach phonepe customer care support. Hence reducing the rate to 1",

Also sometimes the upi id you paid to is not even visible. I have no other complaint. Hope it improves!",
        "Until last update I'm very happy with app but after update I don't see the transactions getting updated in the contact person's list. It shows in the history of the user, but not in the contact person's list. I tried a lot to reach customer care support but the ivr is not providing an option to connect with the customer support agent. Even in app also there is no option to report my problem. So rectify the issue as soon as possible are phonepe may loose many customers",
        "The app screen has too many other icon on the screen when one opens the App. This clutter and many unnecessary advertisement and the purple color is a little jarring to the eyes. A more soft color contrast will be better for viewing. I have just joined PhonePe and a user of GPay, therefore speaking on customer experience as a senior citizen. Probably may be the user can choose the color scheme. This would solve this issue. The scan icon is not very Self explanatory.",
        "It is very very very Worst App. It is frequently going off. Not working more than 10 days one's installed. When want to transfer money a circle is taking round on the screen saying \"setting of your experience\". The screen never coming to normal. And I have to uninstall the App. Again I have to install. Useless App. Close the App and business immediately.",
        "1. The UI is not good. It took me quite some time to understand how it works, & that too very basic operations. Your competitors are much better. 2. For paying to an individual, one has to necessarily link bank account no. to Phone Pe. This is a big no-no. 3. I dowloaded app since was impressed with ad during worldcup, but now find that it was not worth the effort.",
        "After the latest update phonepe is showing so many unwanted messages and ads. As a loyal user of PhonePe, I have always appreciated the seamless experience and convenience it provides. However, these unexpected messages and ads are negatively impacting my overall experience with the app. I kindly request your assistance in resolving this issue as soon as possible. If this problem persists, it would regrettably force me to uninstall the PhonePe app from my smartphone .",
        "Reliable,easy to use fast! edit suggestions: the app is 80%used for payments.The scan icon should beused for peyments. The scan icon should be somewhere in the center or at the bottom of the screen currently the scan icon is on the top of the screen, where is not easily accessible specily old people with unsteady hands and low eyesing struggle to click UI/UX team should focus more on the usability.",
        "PhonePe UPI app has truly revolutionized my digital payment experience. Its user-friendly interface makes transactions effortless. I love how seamlessly it integrates with my bank accounts, allowing me to transfer money, pay bills, and recharge with just a few taps. The security measures, like UPI PIN and fingerprint authentication, ensure peace of mind. Plus, the cashback offers and rewards make every transaction rewarding. Overall, PhonePe is my go-to app for all my payment needs.",
        "Classic app. Never seen such a comfortable payment app, which helps you transact smoothly with a plethora of services like vehicle insurance, health insurance, fastag top-up etc... All done without any delay or confusing requirements. Great to see ...keep it guys!",
        "I have invested certain types amount in wealth section of the app. And I am not able to withdraw. Whenever I try it shows this error \" we are currently unable to process your withdrawal request. please try again later. \" I am trying to contact and speak to customer executive but the dailer doesn't have any option. Have sent several mail. No response either. Need a fix.",
        "Really very good and user friendly mobile app and one can use it with ease without any difficulty. I have used this mobile app for all payments and transfer of money to other accounts since long and not encountered any problems. Thanks to the software developers and phonepay management and staff. Good luck in all your future endeavors.",
        "PhonePe app is fantastic! It offers seamless transactions, quick bill payments, and a user-friendly interface. With its wide range of services and excellent security features, it's my go-to app for all my financial needs. Highly recommend!",
        "Good UI app for transection and instantly response from coustomer care . But interface is not good for all , after paying through QR , beneficiary's Name And paid amount doesn't visible while reading from 1/5 metre, u should do like Paytm,payzapp, GooglePe , it's transection details visible from distance. Another problem is no option for Delete chatting unlike other app.",
        "From the start of this week (18th December) I have been unable to make payments via phonpe. It has created a lot of trouble for me as I don't have the habit of keeping cash now. The payment interface reaches till enter the amount and after clicking proceed it just shows an error msg saying 'Something went wrong, please try again later'. I have trying to talk to a customer support agent of phonepe for last 5 days but it's just impossible, only write and haven't heard back anything from them.",
        "Dear Phonepe Team, Services provided by Phonepe application are really great and very reliable, but I'll also request you to add one search option on front screen in the application since you offfcer multiple range of services. e.g I commute by metro on work days, each time I want to use the metro service, I need to scroll down and search the metro Icon.",
        "This is a very good and helpful app, i really liked the interface, however It has some very irritating bugs Sometimes when I try to check my bank balance it shows unable to check the bank balance at this moment try again later Also sometimes it shows that it is unable to process transactions using UPI at the moment please try again later.It gets very irritating sometimes when you don't carry any cash with you and get stuck in these technical glitches. I request the developers to acknowledge.",
        "Earlier was working good but since 2 weeks after recognizing QR code I put amount after that it just goes connecting securely and stuck there , it go forward to pay amount and get otp , same for paying to mobile numbers after putting amount it shows something went wrong , so NOT able to do any payments. , plz do something for these issues. I really annoyed with this.",
        "I like the App so much it's easy and user friendly but there's a problem that you really need to take serious action that if you want to delet someone's transaction history there is no such option available, I think you guys really need to pay attention on this problem because as a user of your app I really enjoying my payment and transaction it really very helpful. But please try solve this problem in your next update",
        "As a prominent user, PhonePe's popularity doesn't translate to usability. The UI is nice, but confusing layout and lack of offers make it a chore. Cashbacks are non-existent compared to competitors, and irrelevant third-party deals clutter the experience. Frequent payment errors and slow processing raise trust issues. PhonePe needs a user-centric overhaul and competitive offers to stay relevant.",
        "Fast and reliable. However, a search icon on top would make life easy when searching from the plethora of features in the app. I find it a little overwhelming to find what I want to use within the app without the search function.",
        "Highly disappointed about phonepe app. I used this app to pay .. amount debited from my phonepe account but amount not credited to customer account. I paid my cash left and create ticket to fix it . They asking go back to same shop again . Or asking to go bank . Finally my money lost . It is my third time for me . That shop does not have Paytm wallet else I suppose to use Paytm . They are better than phonepe in my experience",
        "Amazing app , this app is far better than any app like gpay, paytm, bhim, Airtel payment, Amazon and etc bcz of its a unique feature of showing transactional history. You can see your all transactions from any app which you done but in other app it showing only their transactional history not all For feature I appreciating phone pe all over time .",
        "This upi payment app never gives any useful cashback or cashback offers like other upi payment apps. And also there are lots of bugs in phonepe. It takes extra charges for Mobile recharges. Overall it's not a user friendly app. No, the app is not bad. But I won't say it's good, it's good, the app comes in handy when it's necessary to send money, so you don't have to go to the online store. But why does the platform fee #extra charge get cut if you recharge the phone \ud83e\udd10\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\udd2a",
        "There should be an option for canceling of pending payments. A hard earned money when is pending during the transaction is very painful, being a purchaser you will definitely pay the recipient twice either in cash/digital, as the earlier transaction is pending. It may either be successful or declined by the bank, in both case the user has to suffer either financially/mentally. Consoling oneself via chat bots is way easier than facing the problem by self. UPI may please look into it.",
        "Worest app this upi transition l've only been using this app for 6 months, but last month there was an issue with it that wasn't resolved, and the amount was not small. This is the absolute worst app, and i would not recommend it to anyone who uses it. There was no solution to any problem. \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21",
        "One of the worst app i have seen. After transferring the amount from credit card to wallet they say we can't transfer the same to our own bank account. And after cancellation of wallet I got msg that amount has been credited to my credit card but till now it's not credited my bank account nor to my card. So I am raising this issue to consumer court and issue the legal notice to phonepe. I have tried todopayment also through wallet today morning its not been done. So it's very worst app. Worst",
        "Problem with widget, (scan QR), the biometric lock (face camera) is not working when I open from widget. And that's why I also can not open this app from widget. Android 11 RMX2027, but from Google pay and Paytm the biometric lock working fine, only phonepe malfunctioning, so I think it is not a mobile problem. And it only happens when I turn on the option \"Screen Lock - Biometric and screen locks\" from phonepe settings. I have done all update , clear data, even uninstalled, nothing working.",
        "OLD: Till today the app was so good. But after evening the app was udated automatically and i didnt do it. Then 24k gold option was taken from it . There is no safe gold or MMTC pamp. They all replaced by Gold fund. I lost all my money. They have not sent any alert messages before removing mmtc pamp and safe gold.. .I need my money back... NEW review: After I update my app, I got the new 24k gold with more features. Its my fault not updating the app for a long time. Thank U."
