        "The interface is a complete mess. Navigating through the app to find a particular option is like trying to rummage through a junkyard to find a lost item. Additionally, the customer care is virtually non existent. Most of the customer care is a non interactive IVR that is complete useless. Forget communicating with agents; even the chat bot isn't a two way communication. The chat bot only gives you options to choose from and if your problem isn't listed, well, too bad. Deal with it yourself.",
        "The UI is just so annoying and cluttered. It's so much hassle to search for a service like if you want to go to movies section to book a movie ticket you have to scroll really down and then you find it. It's full of advertisements. The users will definitely get confused of where to scroll up, down, right or left and atlast the user is left clueless of where to find the specific service he wants to do. The UI needs a major revamp to make it simple, user-friendly.",
        "It has been 1 year and I can't add money to my wallet as the pop up says owing to the internal criteria and none of the help desk people are able to help me even after multiple contacts with them, even getting in contact with the support people is a nightmare. What a mess this app has become. It was my go to app but now its just sitting in my phone memory, I think its time to delete it.",
        "It was one of the best apps a few years ago, and customer care was also good. They used to provide good assistance when query was raised, and also support on call was great, but as the customer base grew and on chat support came they don't dare to reply to queries nor we can connect to them now. It has become too much of a super app. Edit: Currently, I don't have any queries. I just posted a review of what I have experienced over the years, and I can say surely it is not the same anymore.",
        "The UI of this payment app is a nightmare. It bombards users with useless ads and distracting elements that make it impossible to find even the simplest features like recharge history or the recharge menu. And the worst part? You have no clue where to access the payment history you've made. It's time for the developers to reflect on their life choices and find a rock to crawl under.",
        "Since two days I am trying to close the fastag, the process is taking me to the last step but when submitting, message is popped up that open dispute is there against the fastag. When I am checking my tickets, its showing no open issues and all are shown as solved. Moreover it is asking me to contact customer support, but while clicking on it again the same steps are getting repeated. Can anyone tell how to contact the customer care, the in app process is of no use. I have not raised any query",
        "Bad service experience I tried booking a train ticket through the app and the navigation from the site was poor. The app was not responding and showed failure of booking . There is no two way communication option even in help service they provide. Te bot responds only to the predesigned questions and gives options to user giving no option to communicate and resolve the issue.Update the poor app interface. Disappointed \ud83d\ude11",
        "The user interface and app experience is worst. This app is so cluttered with ads and promotions that it is unable to be the one thing it is supposed to be, a PAYMENTS app! Useful features like Tap and Pay are buried deep under its hideous UI. I'd rather switch to another app than having to navigate through this app everytime I need to make a simple payment.",
        "The postpaid service is a scam, even though the bill is repaid on time, i am charged extra everytime after the bill payment and they made it impossible to reach the customer service executive regarding postpaid issues. The chat service is so terrible that they send a few pre decided texts all the time and leave you no option but to end the chat. Postpaid was down for more than three weeks, now suddenly they charged late fees for prev bills there was no service at all. 1 \u2b50 is also such a waste.",
        "Of late, this has started giving a number of issues especially on the paytm digi gold page. It does not allow to goto the sell gold page at all, thus enabling me to suspect Paytm blocks people not to sell the digi gold balances. Trying to send feedback to them through app, however the same error occurs there as well. Error 1015 is really annoying!",
        "Paytm has the absolute worst costumer service. They are not even interested to solve the problem the costumer has. I lost my phone number and I wanted it to change to other number but it doesn't allow me to do it. It always asks to login from a number when I don't have access to it. And it doesn't land at all on the page to change the number. Through IVR you can't even talk to a person.",
        "I'm stuck up with some amount to be recieved and this app doesn't even provide proper customer service. I've tried calling so many times and keeps on lingering around only one stupid concept of completing my KYC. Even though I've done that multiple times. The transaction is not listed in any of its history, but the transaction was made by the other person. I have its UTR and this application doesn't even have the service to talk to an executive. Waste application.",
        "Very bad experience. Unable to reach out to customer care by any means. My transaction shows successful and the receiver hasn't received the amount. Doesn't care about their customers. Will not recommend to anyone. No response even after sharing the order ID. The response here also is just a fake show. No response or assurance after almost 24 hours of the issue being reported. Feels like my money is gone. Use this app if you don't care about your money.",
        "I've been using the Paytm app for quite some time, and its user-friendly interface and seamless transactions have made it a go-to choice for many. The app's versatility, from mobile recharges to bill payments, has undoubtedly simplified my financial transactions.However, the recent government decision to potentially ban the Paytm app has left me bewildered. While I can only speculate on the reasons behind this move, I believe it's crucial for the government to communicate clearly and transparent",
        "The app does not allow me to link my NRO account linked to my US number despite NPCI allowing numbers from 10 countries. Responding to reply: I don't see any ticketing system in the link. Also, the ask is very generic. Allow us to use an international number from the approved countries to register. Should not be hard. Or at least allow us to link our net banking account directly.",
        "I usually don't give a feedback to any of the apps. But, being a financial app it needs a lot of improvement. Never missed a repayment, and still no improvement in loan department. Always gets rejected for no reason. Can't use the wallet all of a sudden for no reason. Etc........ Disappointed \ud83d\ude1e \ud83d\ude25 \ud83d\ude1e",
        "\ufeffWorst Costumers care support The customer care is virtually non existent. Most of the customer care is a non interactive IVR that is complete useless. Forget communicating with agents; even the chat bot isn't a two way communication. The chat bot only gives you options to choose from and if your problem isn't listed, well, too bad. Deal with it yourself.",
        "Title: Frustrating Experience with Mobile Number Update Updating my mobile number on the Paytm app was an absolute nightmare. The interface is a maze, and finding the option is an ordeal. The verification process is unnecessarily complex and plagued with constant app crashes. Clear instructions are sorely lacking, adding to the frustration. Customer support is non-responsive, leaving users stranded. Paytm needs a serious overhaul of its mobile number update process",
        "The worst app I have ever encountered in my life. I am unable to retrieve my money from this app, and its customer support is nonexistent. Nothing is aiding me in resolving this issue, and I am persistently attempting to recover my funds, but there is no assistance within this app. It is a highly unsatisfactory app with absolutely no support. I urge the Play Store to remove such apps from its platform so that users can access reliable and trustworthy applications.",
        "For any techie or enthusiast, this payment must have been one of the best one. For me at least the functionality of Wallets and Payments Banks was the best! I even bought a ncmc RapidX card but my dismay that I won't be able to use it anymore :( I really don't know the government's motive but I really love using your services and will continue to do so! [Though I kinda understand that scammers are a real nuisance]",
        "Worst payment app, do not use their wallet services it's a scam, they allow you to add money to the Wallet but at the time of withdrawal or transfering back to your bank account they do not allow, it always end up saying KYC unavailable at the moment, your money will be stuck with them and can Neve be withdrawn. They don't even bother about resolving it.",
        "I need help!! I sent money (\u20b93000) to my sister through her Mobile No. but it was recieved by someone else who we don't even know about, his name is called 'Ulay Mag' on the transaction details, i called customer services several times and they are not helping much, i've sent money to her several times before from other apps and it works just fine but when i sent her through Paytm Apps, the whole amount went straight to that person's account, i still have all the transaction details and histoy.",
        "Absolutely irresponsible and frequent transaction failures. I am uninstalling this scam of an app. They fail or keep transactions pending and act like money has been transferred while it's not reflected in merchant's account. Better switch to phone pe. They even loot customers with unnecessary Paytm postpaid with high interest amounts. I wish I could give negetive stars",
        "For transaction it is good but for wallet payment it very bad. I add money to wallet but from that time it is showing to update kyc. And when I am trying to add money so it is not working and saying try again on continue basis. Basically my money is stuck with paytm. I can't use this or tranfer to my bank account.",
        "I am using a Paytm fastag which is connected to my Paytm wallet. I want to connect with an executive for an issue but there is no option available in 24x7 Help and chat option. While trying to reach through customer care number the IVR also does not have any option to connect to the executive who can at least listen to my issue, forget resolving it. If you try to reach the executive through other options the call never gets transferred to fastag dept as informed by the person you reach by luck",
        "Pathetic app and even worse service. They have the most glitchy app and seems like they are least interested in fixing bugs. They can't even have the Manage Fastag feature work. I have tried updating the app but it's still not working. The chatbot is also of no use, I feel scared for a future of ai with this kind of application. Zero star if possible",
        "Third class app which I have never seen before.upi is not working. there is no customer care to talk about problems.forcefully sound box was issued.i have cancelled sound box in just 3 days but amount is deducted. I can't send amount to others it's really horrible for what purpose I have to use this application really Its useless app plz plz don't use this no one is there to solve your problems. Thank you",
        "RBI takes right action \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d worst app, ticket booked and it got cancelled 1 hour before journey automatically without reason. Unable to reach customer care. Ticket also closed as amount refunded, but they took Rs.100 for cancellation charges. Good business. How to manage travel in hour? Tried to close all accounts with payment, but that's also unsuccessful. No negative rating? Where you go they set 10 question and answer only that and Not your issues. I want to close all, pls help.",
        "This sucks , you talk to customer support no matter how hard you try. I booked a flight ticket and wanted to have it rescheduled but no customer support number is available and their bot is useless. Because of this I will now have to send 90k on a new ticket and cancel the other ticket for a loss. Poorly thought of app.",
        "This app is no more user friendly. UI structure sucks. It will take you entire day to look for a desired option which is buried somewhere. Customer care is an illusion. If you are lucky you can end up unveiling the number otherwise you are stuck with the useless bot which gives you headache. Sheer disappointing!",
        "Personally I like the app. The transactions are smooth across the platform. Having said that, the ONDC platform ui is absolutely pathetic. It's extremely slow and clunky. It needs to be fixed asap. Can't even track the orders on it. Very Disappointed",
        "Extremely frustrating customer service. The in-app help and support is a chatbot with limited options which DO NOT INCLUDE reporting cashback not getting credited. Tried calling their customer service and was passed from one agent to another on the premise that this was another department. Final resolution by the second agent - send me a link to in-app customer service to raise the complaint despite my repeated explanation that the app has no provision to handle such issues. Case study material.",
        "After the recent update, Paytm postpaid is no longer working, and it sucks!!. Till date, I haven't delayed making repayment on Paytm postpaid. It's been over a month, but I still am not able to use the postpaid limit on my payment. Respective department, please monitor this issue and help out by fixing it.",
        "The app keeps stopping on its own since the last 3 days. I contacted customer support but they told me to come back after 2 days. I also got a call few months ago regarding free soundbox and zero rental from an associate of Paytm. The rental started getting deducted after few months. It has been almost 3 months since I am requesting them to take back the soundbox but the response from other side is not up to the mark. Posting this so that others become aware.",
        "Used paytm postpaid of \u20b9500 and then the postpaid option just disappeared after a month. Now all of a sudden the postpaid option pops up with charges and late fees. Got a call from two women regarding postpaid dues payment and both refused to hear me out and the issue i was facing during paying that 500. There was no option to pay and now all of sudden they are calling for payment that 8\u00d7 more than what i used",
        "Worst App!Fraud! To transfer money from wallet to bank, one needs to complete a kyc process, which would never succeed even after multiple video session. 0 help from customer support. Even unable to open a support ticket. Everytime I try to create request, it just pops out saying 'facing technical issues try after sometime'. Been trying for the past few weeks. These people are holding up people's hard earned money and making profit out of the interest. True fraudsters !",
        "Best UPI app when compared to other upi apps. Tried well to accomodate all the options in the UI. This can be improved and hope eventually get improved. Liked the view to see all the transactions in one place. It would be good to view a transaction history for a merchant from history view. This is missing now. Update: Requested feature is available in the Dec 23 Update. Thanks Guys. \ud83d\udc4d",
        "Excellent. I am using it since two years. When we clik on Pay, the choice \"scan any QR code\" comes at bottom centre of the screen. It's very easy to use, gets more offers and cashbacks too. It has many features to explore.",

        "Until last month I was able to pay house rent using postpaid loan, but this month it is showing this option is not available after paying my bill when I tried to use it. No clarification as to where I can use this balance. If not usable, then it is better close Paytm. Postpaid option for payment is not working for me, showing this payment option not available."
