At a minimum you should at least be able to choose or have a setting that lets you toggle between one and the other.

Every time I try to add the account it states that your account is liked with many accounts but I only have 1 account in the bank. I also had a talk with the bank but they said it's the app's fault and error. It's been more then a month. Please let me know what can I do as I'm not able to uninstall the app.",
